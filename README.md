## ✨ Homework Completed — FastAPI Edition! 🚀

Today’s mission:
Build a mini banking system with /authenticate and /bank-transfer endpoints…
Basically, I became the CEO of a fake bank for one evening 😎💰

## 👤 Step 1: Authenticate user
🔐 Name + Pin = Entry to the VIP vault

## 💸 Step 2: /bank-transfer
Transfer money like a pro (without actually losing any, thankfully 😂)

📉 Sender balance goes down
📈 Receiver balance goes up
(If only real life worked this fast 😭)

## 🔄 Step 3: Re-authenticate the receiver to check the new balance
FastAPI said: “Congratulations, your money is gone successfully!” 😂

Honestly, this assignment felt like:

Me coding at 1 AM: “I am the bank.”
FastAPI: “Declined. Fix your indentation.”

But Alhamdulillah, it’s DONE! 🙌
Enjoyed building this logic — small project, big brain workout 🧠⚡

On to the next one! 💜🔥
